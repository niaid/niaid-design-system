        <p><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a JavaScript library that, according to its website, "makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers." In other words, jQuery simplifies many different different tasks in plain JavaScript. NDS is making strides to decouple from jQuery to provide more flexibility for developers, however, jQuery currently remains a dependency.</p>
