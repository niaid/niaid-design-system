        <h2>Building a Static Website</h2>
        <p>With NDS, building a static website is incredibly quick and easy. While you may use any framework, NDS encourages the use of Pattern Lab for its Atomic Design benefits and organizational advantages. The following steps will detail how to create a Pattern Lab instance to manage your static website.</p>

        <h2>ADD TWIG &amp; PATTERNLAB EXPLANATION</h2>

        <h3>Initialization</h3>
        <p class="step">1. Download the Static Website Package:</p>
        <p>
            {% include "@nds/01-atoms/buttons/button-icon/_button-icon-main.twig" with
                {
                    "button_icon_href": assetsPath ~ "nds.zip",
                    "button_icon_icon": "download",
                    "button_icon_text": "Download NDS",
                    "button_icon_attributes": "download"
                }
            %}
        </p>
        <p class="step mt-5">2. Unzip and Open the Directory in Your Preferred Code Editor.</p>
        <p>Editors like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> are free to download and provide many features that make development easier.</p>
        <p class="step">3. Install Node and Composer Dependencies</p>
        <code>npm install</code><br>
        <code>composer install</code><br>
        <p>When you run "composer install" there may be a prompt asking if you want to install a default theme. Type "n" and hit enter.</p>
        {% include "@nds/02-molecules/components/component-media/_component-media-main.twig" with
            {
                "component_media_src": 'composer-install.png',
                "component_media_alt": 'See caption for details',
                "component_media_credit": 'NIAID, Office of Communications and Government Relations (OCGR)',
                "component_media_caption": 'Do not install the default theme when prompoted by typing "n" and hitting enter.',
                "component_media_lightbox": "yes"
            }
        %}
        <p class="step">4. Open the Project on Your Localhost</p>
        <code>gulp</code><br>
        <p>This will compile your project and create a localhost with your patterns and pages. Use the black bar at the top to navigate to your components.</p>
        <h3>Building NDS for Production</h3>
        <p>NDS provides a way to quickly build a distribution folder with all the necessary, web-ready assets. Upon build, the assets are generated and placed into a public_html/ directory.</p>
        <p class="step">1. Create a Distribution Pattern Folder.</p>
        <p>Start by creating a 06-dist/ folder under _patterns/ (source/_patterns/06-dist/).</p>
        {% include "@nds/02-molecules/components/component-media/_component-media-main.twig" with
            {
                "component_media_src": 'dist.png',
                "component_media_alt": 'See caption for details',
                "component_media_credit": 'NIAID, Office of Communications and Government Relations (OCGR)',
                "component_media_caption": "Create a 06-dist/ directory.",
                "component_media_float": "right",
                "component_media_lightbox": "yes"
            }
        %}
        <p>For each page of your static site, create a new folder (typically with the same name as the corresponding 05-pages/ directory) and add a twig file, such as design.twig, and a JSON file with the same name, such as design.json.</p>
        {% include "@nds/02-molecules/components/component-media/_component-media-main.twig" with
            {
                "component_media_src": 'json.png',
                "component_media_alt": 'See caption for details',
                "component_media_credit": 'NIAID, Office of Communications and Government Relations (OCGR)',
                "component_media_caption": "An example JSON file in the 06-dist/ directory.",
                "component_media_lightbox": "yes"
            }
        %}
        <p class="step">2. Configure the Production JSON Files</p>
        <p>The JSON file in each page's 06-dist folder is critical for defining production-specific information, including the paths for your CSS, JS, and image assets, page titles, and included scripts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configure the variable paths (cssPath, jsPath, etc.) to your desired structure.</p>
            <li>Include or exclude certain JS libraries from the build by setting 'true' or 'false' values, respectively.</li>
            <li>If using an NDS-based navigation element, use the "navigationPrimaryActiveLink" parameter to add active page styling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may also add your own parameters for use in custom patterns.</p>

        <p class="step">3. Configure Gulp Paths to Your Production Pages</p>
        <p>Once your 06-dist/ directory is setup, compile Pattern Lab. Next, open your gulpfile.js, and find the "buildPaths" variable declaration. For every page you want to deploy, add a new object. For pageName, add the name of the folder/file for that page in 06-dist/. For target_dest, specify the ultimate path you want that page to file under.</p>
        {% include "@nds/02-molecules/components/component-media/_component-media-main.twig" with
            {
                "component_media_src": 'build-paths-gulp.png',
                "component_media_alt": 'See caption for details',
                "component_media_credit": 'NIAID, Office of Communications and Government Relations (OCGR)',
                "component_media_caption": "A sample buildPaths variable declaration.",
                "component_media_lightbox": "yes"
            }
        %}
        <p class="step">4. Build the Distribution Directory</p>
        <code>gulp buildProd</code><br>
        <p>After running the buildProd command, a public_html/ directory will be created with production ready assets. Upload the contents of this directory to your hosting platform.</p>
