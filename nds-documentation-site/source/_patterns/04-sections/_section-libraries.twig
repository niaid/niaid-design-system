        </ul>
        <p>This section describes what these libraries are and how they factor into development with NDS.</p>
        <h3>Bootstrap 4</h3>
        {% include "@nds/01-atoms/text/text-badge/_text-badge-main.twig" with
            {
                "text_badge_text": "Version: 4.5.2"
            }
        %}
        <p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is a front end library that provides stylesheets and functional components designed to accelerate web development. While NDS relies on Bootstrap primarily for its grid system, other functional components, such as dropdowns and modals, are also leveraged.</p>
        
        <h3>Font Awesome</h3>
        {% include "@nds/01-atoms/text/text-badge/_text-badge-main.twig" with
            {
                "text_badge_text": "Version: 5.15.1"
            }
        %}
        <p><a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> is the NIAID Design System's official icon vendor. NDS provides the infrastructure to use the Free version of Font Awesome icons out of the box. If you have a need for extended support or would like to request access to Font Awesome Pro, please use the <a href="https://ecollab.niaid.nih.gov/sites/portalprojects/Lists/Box/NewForm2.aspx">Web Request Form</a> to submit a request.</p>

        <h3>Materialize</h3>
        {% include "@nds/01-atoms/text/text-badge/_text-badge-main.twig" with
            {
                "text_badge_text": "Version: 1.0.0"
            }
        %}
        <p><a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> is a front end library that has converted guidance from Google's Material Design documentation into code. The main utility of this library that is leveraged in NDS is the Parallax effect for hero images. Other capabilities may be used for custom needs as well.</p>
        <h3>DataTables</h3>
        {% include "@nds/01-atoms/text/text-badge/_text-badge-main.twig" with

            }
        %}
        <p>Tables can be tricky on the web for accessibility and responsive reasons. NDS employs <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> to create properly formatted, simple tables and improve the experience of tables across devices. Adding the custom attribute nds-datatable="true" to the table tag will initizlaize the responsive functionality of DataTables.</p>
        <h3>Select2</h3>
        {% include "@nds/01-atoms/text/text-badge/_text-badge-main.twig" with
            {
                "text_badge_text": "Version: 4.0.13"
            }
        %}
        <p><a href="https://select2.org/">Select2</a> enhances dropdown fields (select elements) by adding additional functionality such as inline searching and multi-select.</p>
        <h3>Bootstrap Datepicker</h3>
        {% include "@nds/01-atoms/text/text-badge/_text-badge-main.twig" with
            {
                "text_badge_text": "Version: 1.9.0"
            }
        %}
