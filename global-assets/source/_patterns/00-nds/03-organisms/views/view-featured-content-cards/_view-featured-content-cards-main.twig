    title: Featured Content Cards View
    ---

    Type: Organisms -> Views

    Description:
        Featured Content Cards are excellent for highlighting information, but too many can be overwehelming and can reduce the relative importance of each card. NDS recommends two or three cards be included when using the Featured Content Cards View.

        The Featured Content Card component can be used either by utilizing the {% block view_featured_content_cards_content %} or by passing data to the "view_featured_content_cards_data" parameter. If using the parameter, the component will calculate the correct width of the Bootstrap columns ("view_featured_content_cards_column_width") based on the number of card objects passed. Therefore, if using the parameter option, you do not need to specify a value for "view_featured_content_cards_column_width".

    Blocks:
        {% block view_featured_content_cards_content %}: The block containing featured content cards.

    Parameters:
        view_featured_content_cards_classes: Additional classes for view wrapper.
        view_featured_content_cards_id: ID for the view.
        view_featured_content_cards_data: An array of featured content card objects. Structure: {"src": "", "alt": "", "title": "", "href": "", "description": "", "featured": ""}. See the Featured Content Card pattern for more information.
        view_featured_content_cards_column_breakpoint: The Bootstrap column breakpoint for the view. Options: "sm", "md" (Default), "lg", "xl".
        view_featured_content_cards_column_width: The Bootstrap column width for the view. Options: "1", "2", "3", "4", "6" (Default), "12".
