    ---

    Type: Molecules -> Forms

    Description:
        Search allows users to find content on your site. A search feature is almost always recommended for websites, unless the website is only a few pages.

        Read more guidance about Search from the U.S. Web Design System.

        The Search Form pattern has a default <form> element that can be replaced by passing your own to the "form_search_content" block.

    Blocks:
        {% block form_search_content %}: The block holding the search form HTML.

    Parameters:
        form_search_classes: Additional classes on the wrapper around the search form.
        form_search_id: ID of the <form> element.

    Includes:
        Atoms -> Input -> input-text
